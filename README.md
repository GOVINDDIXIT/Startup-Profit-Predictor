# Startup Profit Predictor

*A Startup Profit Predictor machine learning model based on **Multiple Linear Regression**, can be used to predict the profit of the Startups based on their expenditure on marketing, research & development and adminstration expenses .*
 
### DataSet
Dataset consists of 50 entries of startups with the expenditures and the relative profits

- *Training Set = 80% of total dataset = 40 entries*

- *Test Set = 20% of total dataset = 10 entries*

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.
